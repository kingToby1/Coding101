#variables are numbers or strings that you can assign to different variables.
#example
x = 'hello'
print(x)
#in this example x is the variable that is equal to the string 'hello' when you say print(x) it's really saying
# print('hello')
#example2
z = 'world'
y = x+z
print(y)
#in this example it is saying that y is equal to the value x+z. z is equal to 'hello' and x is equal to 'world' so in this 
#case it would be 'hello' + 'world' which is equal to 'helloworld' so y = 'helloworld'. the reason it won't do spaces is 
#because you never put in spaces so instead of making z 'world', you can modify it to make ' world' now hit run. 
#It should now look like this >>>hello world or >>>helloworld depending on if you put a space on the 'world' string or not.


#means comment if your a begginer :)
